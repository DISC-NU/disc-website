          The <strong>Discover Program</strong> connects student tech developers
          with local organizations that have software needs. Through this
          2-quarter-long program, teams of 5-6 students build an industry-grade
          web application from start to finish that solves a critical problem
          for one of our clients. All of the clients we work with are local
          nonprofits or startups, making this a great opportunity to give back
          to the community while gaining technical experience.
