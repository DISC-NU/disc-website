            Since 2017, DISC has been transforming how Northwestern students
            engage with technology and community impact. What started as a small
            student group has grown into a dynamic community of innovators,
            bringing together diverse perspectives and skills to tackle
            real-world challenges.
            <br />
            <br />
            We believe in the power of collaboration across disciplines. By
            combining technical expertise with creative problem-solving, we've
            built lasting partnerships with organizations throughout the
            Evanston/Chicago area. Our project teams blend computer science,
            design, and social impact to create solutions that matter.
